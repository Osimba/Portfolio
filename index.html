      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="#" alt="[Pic of me]">
      <p>I am a graduate from Arizona State University, receiving my diploma in May 2017. My major was Computer Systems Engineering which focuses on, not only programming and coding, but also hardware and the communication between hardware and software. However, since graduating, I've been investing my time in learning web development.

        <br>I am a web developer and I can showcase my skills through a variety of projects through my account on code pen. I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as PHP for server-side applications, and I am comfortable in developing in all of these languages. I am fully aware that I can never stop learning in this continuously growing field, but I am confident that there isn't any task that I cannot tackle with my skill set.

        <br>I truly enjoy being able to work as a web developer and help my client's dream or vision become a reality. The most exciting thing about web development for me is being able to build and create something. With that said, I aspire to make the dream of every client complete with the skills that I am passionate about.</p>
